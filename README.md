Movement Mod
============

Changes the player movement mechanics, making it more like that of the Source engine.

Installing
----------

Go to the releases tab on the right, download the latest release, and install it with [UMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).

Mechanics
---------

The mod adds airstrafing and bunnyhopping, much like in Source. It also changes the ground movement to have more of a sense of weight, with customisable run speed and acceleration. In addition, your momentum is now preserved when jumping on or onto a moving train.

There is a setting to make the air movement more like HL2 and Portal, which limits bunnyhopping speed, but the ABH/AFH glitch has been replicated (Portal was used as a reference, I haven't played HL2).

Vertical movement and swimming are unaffected in the current version.

Settings
--------

| Setting | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Auto bunnyhopping | Automatically jump if space is held | `true` |
| sv_airaccelerate | Air acceleration | `100` |
| max_wishspeed | `max_wishspd` parameter (leave this alone if you don't know what it does) | `1` |
| ABH | Enable ABH/AFH (limits bunnyhopping speed to run speed) | `true` |
| Max ABH speed | Cap on ABH speed to prevent clipping out of the map | `250` |
| Mod ground movement | Enable the custom ground movement | `true` |
| Run speed | Max running speed (also applies in the air) | `6` |
