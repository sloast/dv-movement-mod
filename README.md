Gravity Gun
===========

Lets you push train cars around, pick them up, and fling them many miles away :)

Based on [template-umm](https://github.com/derail-valley-modding/template-umm)

Installing
----------

Go to the releases tab on the right, download the latest release, and install it with [UMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).

Usage
-----

- Open the radio and go to "Gravity Gun"
- Click on a car to pick it up
- Click to release it
- The car follows the laser pointer of the radio
- Scroll to move the car closer or further
- Hold `Ctrl` and scroll to change the force of the gun
- Middle click to fling the car

Settings
--------

Has settings for base force, damping, etc.
"Min offset to derail" changes how hard you need to pull a car upwards for it to derail.
"Grab at CoM" changes the behaviour of the gun to always pick up cars from their centre of mass (i.e. applies no torque to the car). Enabling this makes it a lot easier to fly by standing ontop of a car and grabbing.

Issues
------

Don't create issues here, I won't read them.
Instead, ping `@adaad` in the [Altfuture Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/altfuture).
